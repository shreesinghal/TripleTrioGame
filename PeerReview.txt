The provided interfaces showcase an impressive and thoughtful design that effectively demonstrates strong design
principles and understanding of the project. For example, the TripleTriad interface correctly extends a
ReadOnlyTripleTriad, which is an excellent example of separating mutable and immutable game states. The view interfaces
 beautifully implement the MVC pattern, with ViewFeatures providing a clean, decoupled mechanism for interaction between
view and controller.

The implementation reveals a sophisticated approach to building a game interface. The ThreeTriosView leverages Java
Swing effectively, creating a user-friendly graphical interface with intuitive features like card highlighting and
informative popup messages. The careful design of methods such as selectedCard() and advance() demonstrates a nuanced
understanding of interactive game design. The implementation shows careful consideration of user experience, with
methods that allow for dynamic updating of the game state and clear communication of game events.\

Each interface method is accompanied by clear, precise Javadoc comments that comprehensively explain method purposes,
parameters, return values, and potential exceptions. The Card interface, in particular, offers exemplary documentation
that leaves no ambiguity about method behaviors. The comments provide just the right level of detail, making the code
both readable and self-explanatory. This level of documentation significantly reduces the learning curve for
developers who might work with or extend these interfaces.

The design demonstrates several strengths that make it a robust and well-thought-out implementation. The clear
separation of concerns, well-defined interfaces, and thoughtful method signatures provide an excellent foundation for
a flexible game framework. While there are always opportunities for refinement, the current design shows tremendous
potential for extensibility and maintainability. For example, they could hone into exploring additional flexibility in
player and card representations or potentially developing more advanced error handling mechanisms

These suggestions are not critiques but opportunities to build upon an already impressive foundation. The current
implementation provides a solid, well-structured approach to developing a complex game interface that balances
flexibility, usability, and clear design principles.
